					<h2>Number Crunching: Accounting &amp; Taxation</h2>
					<h3>We specialise in small and medium business taxation.</h3>
					<p>At least yearly, we meet with all of our clients to implement the latest tax strategies, minimise tax and plan for upcoming tax liabilities. Tax planning is critical because after 30 June, it’s often too late.</p>
					<p>Minimise your tax and operate in the most tax effective structure for your circumstances. Your structure will determine how profits are taxed, who pays the tax and how often. Take profits in the most tax effective manner and satisfy your tax obligations in a way that is best for your cash flow.</p>
					<p>As part of efficient, accurate, real-time (cloud) accounting, have your tax and accounting obligations taken care of so you can focus on your business. Choose for us to work on your accounts quarterly or monthly and have up-to-date financials throughout the year</p>

					<ul class="bullet-time">
						<li class="single-line"><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg make-it-green"></span>Plan and minimise tax as best as possible, implement latest strategies.</li>
						<li class="single-line"><span class="fa fa-check-square-o fa-lg make-it-green"></span>Know your tax payments 12 months in advance.</li>
					</ul>

					<ul class="bullet-time question-time">
						<li>Does your accountant see you to make sure you have minimised tax with the latest strategies and know your upcoming payments before 30 June?</li>
						<li>Are you in the best structure for tax purposes?</li>

					<h2>Reporting</h2>
					<p>For business owners that want something more than basic tax and accounting services but don’t require full scale business advisory, we have developed a Reporting package.</p>

					<div class="row">

						<div class="small-12 large-6 columns">
							<p>In short, we provide cloud-based business performance reports to business owners every month. Track your business performance as it happens – don't go a year without having accountant reviewed figures! </p>
							<p>The reports are tailored suit your business. They are easy to understand and include more than just balance sheets and P&amp;L's. They include graphs, trends and information on your important numbers.</p>
							<p><strong>Know your numbers:</strong> monitor the key numbers that drive your business. If you don’t know these figures and how you can change them, you need a new accountant!</p>
							<p><strong>Take action and achieve great things:</strong> set yourself some goals and monitor your progress. Detect trends early and if necessary, make changes to your strategy sooner rather than later. If you need advice on strategy or a sounding board to bounce ideas off each month, please see our Business Advisory and Coaching packages <a href="/services/#business-advisory">below</a>.</p>

					<h2>Business Advisory &amp; Coaching</h2>

					<h3>We’re making business coaching affordable</h3>

					<p>We’ve seen external business coaches charge our clients $2,000 + per month. It’s not feasible for a lot of small businesses and often too complicated. So we’ve developed our Business Success Packages. </p>
					<p>Our Business Success Packages are built upon years of informal discussions, meetings and advice to business owners that have resulted in dramatic improvements to business performance. We’ve worked with a large amount of small and medium businesses (from zero to 200 employees!) so we know what works and what doesn’t work. </p>
					<p>We provide a simple and easy to understand process for business owners to increase profits and business value. We identify the numbers that drive your business and your profit and value improvement potential. We set targets and develop strategies to achieve them. The strategies will involve Financial Metrics, Sales, People and Technology. </p>
					<p>We report to you on performance as part of our monthly ‘board’ meetings. We provide an honest account of the figures, make you accountable and adjust strategies to make sure you stay on track. </p>
					<p>Importantly, Steve and Chris are both with you at each meeting and throughout the process. Leverage their combined skillset, knowledge and first-hand experience of family business workings to make the most out of your business. </p>
					<p>From knowledge of complex tax law and the latest time-saving cloud technologies to decades of experience and know-how, they are a powerful team there to help you achieve your goals. Read more about them <a href="/about-us/">here</a>.</p>
